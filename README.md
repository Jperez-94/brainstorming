## Rules

Some rules to avoid kaos and manage to keep different projects organiced.

1. A new project will be created into a new independent branch that will be use as the main of that project until it is merge into the main branch of the repo.
2. The branch type of the main branch of each project will be a feature: **feature/name_of_the_branch**
3. When working at your main branch, follow the work flow you prefer.

Stay creative and lets work!
